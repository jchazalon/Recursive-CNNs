# Dicta
Repository for experimenting with recursive CCNs for real-time document localization. 
Current focus is to run as many experiments as possible. 

The system is already beating state of the art results on a standard dataset. The results will be published in ICDAR 2017.

# Future Goal
A trained model and the algorithm will be made available after the conference deadline.
